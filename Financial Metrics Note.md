## 1. Income Statement Metrics
*Analogy: Think of this as the company's **"Report Card"** for a specific period (like a quarter or a year). It tells you if the company made a profit.*

### Revenue & Gross Profit
* **revenue**: Total sales or income generated from the company's main business activities before any expenses are deducted.
* **cost_of_good_sold**: The direct costs of producing the goods or services a company sells.
* **gross_profit**: The profit left over after subtracting the `cost_of_good_sold` from `revenue`. **What to look for:** A high and growing gross profit indicates a healthy and profitable core business.

### Operating Profit
* **operation_expense**: Expenses related to the company's main business operations, such as salaries, marketing, and rent.
* **operation_profit**: The profit generated from the company's primary business activities. It's calculated as `gross_profit` - `operation_expense`.

* **pre_tax_profit**: Profit before income taxes are paid.
* **post_tax_profit**: Profit after all taxes have been paid.
* **share_holder_income**: The net profit that belongs to the company's shareholders. This is often called the "bottom line" and is a key indicator of profitability.

## 2. Balance Sheet Metrics
*Analogy: This is a **"Snapshot"** of the company's financial health on a single day. It shows what the company owns (assets) and what it owes (liabilities).*

### Assets (What the Company Owns)
* **asset**: The total value of everything the company owns.
* **short_asset**: Assets that are expected to be converted into cash within one year (e.g., cash, short-term investments).
* **cash**: The most liquid asset.
* **short_invest**: Short-term investments that can be easily sold.
* **short_receivable**: Money owed to the company by its customers for goods or services already delivered.
* **inventory**: The value of a company's raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods.
* **long_asset**: Assets that are not expected to be converted into cash within one year (e.g., property, equipment).
* **fixed_asset**: A type of long-term asset, such as buildings and machinery.
* **other_asset**: Miscellaneous assets not categorized elsewhere.

### Liabilities (What the Company Owes)
* **debt**: The total amount of money the company owes to others.
* **short_debt**: Debt that must be paid back within one year.
* **long_debt**: Debt that is due in more than one year.
* **payable**: Money the company owes to its suppliers.
* **other_debt**: Miscellaneous debts.

### Equity (The Company's Net Worth)
* **equity**: The value that would be returned to shareholders if all the assets were liquidated and all the company's debts were paid off. **Formula:** `Equity = Assets - Debt`.
* **capital**: The total amount of money invested in the company by its shareholders.
* **un_distributed_income**: Profits that the company has retained over time rather than paying out as dividends. Also known as Retained Earnings.
* **minor_share_holder_profit**: The portion of profit belonging to minority shareholders in a subsidiary company.

* **central_bank_deposit**: A commercial bank's deposits held at the country's central bank.
* **other_bank_deposit / other_bank_loan**: Deposits held at or loans taken from other commercial banks.
* **customer_loan**: Money loaned out to customers. This is an asset for the bank.
* **bad_loan**: Loans that are unlikely to be repaid by the borrower.
* **provision**: Money set aside to cover potential losses from bad loans.
* **net_customer_loan**: `customer_loan` - `provision`.
* **deposit**: Money that customers have deposited into the bank. This is a liability for the bank.

## 3. Cash Flow Statement Metrics
*Analogy: A **"Video"** of how cash moved in and out of the company. It shows if the company is actually generating cash, which can be different from its reported profit.*

* **from_sale (Cash Flow from Operations)**: Cash generated from the company's normal business operations. **What to look for:** This should be consistently positive. If a company reports profits but has negative cash flow from operations, it's a major red flag.
* **from_invest**: Cash used for or generated from investments, such as buying or selling equipment or other businesses.
* **invest_cost**: The cost of investments made during the period.
* **from_financial**: Cash flow related to financing activities, such as issuing stock or paying back debt.
* **free_cash_flow**: The cash a company has left over after paying for its operating expenses and capital expenditures. This is the cash that can be used to pay dividends, reduce debt, or expand the business. **What to look for:** Positive and growing free cash flow is a very strong sign of financial health.

## 4. Financial Ratios
*Analogy: The **"Doctor's Diagnosis."** These metrics combine data from the other three statements to provide a quick and powerful assessment of the company's overall health, efficiency, and value.*

### Valuation Ratios (Is the stock cheap or expensive?)
* **price_to_earning (P/E)**: The stock price divided by the earnings per share. A higher P/E often means investors expect higher future growth.
* **price_to_book (P/B)**: The stock price divided by the book value per share. A P/B ratio below 1 can indicate that the stock is undervalued.
* **earning_per_share (EPS)**: The company's profit divided by the number of outstanding shares.
* **book_value_per_share**: The company's total equity divided by the number of outstanding shares.
* **value_before_ebitda (EV/EBITDA)**: A ratio that compares a company's Enterprise Value (EV) to its EBITDA. Often used to find attractive investment opportunities.

### Profitability Ratios (How good is the company at making money?)
* **roe (Return on Equity)**: Net income divided by shareholder's equity. It measures how effectively a company is using shareholder money to generate profits. **What to look for:** Consistently above 15% is generally considered good.
* **roa (Return on Assets)**: Net income divided by total assets. It measures how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate profit.
* **gross_profit_margin / operating_profit_margin / post_tax_margin**: These ratios show what percentage of revenue is left after accounting for different types of costs. Higher margins are better.

### Leverage Ratios (How much risk is the company taking with debt?)
* **debt_on_equity**: Total debt divided by total equity. It shows how much the company is relying on debt to finance its assets. **What to look for:** A ratio above 2.0 can indicate a risky level of debt for non-financial companies.
* **debt_on_asset**: Total debt divided by total assets.
* **equity_on_total_asset / equity_on_liability**: Measures the proportion of assets financed by equity.

### Liquidity Ratios (Can the company pay its short-term bills?)
* **current_payment (Current Ratio)**: Current assets divided by current liabilities. A ratio above 1 suggests the company can cover its short-term obligations.
* **quick_payment (Quick Ratio)**: Similar to the current ratio but excludes inventory from current assets. It's a more conservative measure of liquidity.

### Efficiency Ratios (How well is the company managing its operations?)
* **days_receivable**: The average number of days it takes for a company to collect payment from its customers.
* **days_payable**: The average number of days it takes for a company to pay its own bills.
* **days_inventory**: The average number of days it takes for a company to sell its entire inventory. **What to look for:** A lower number is generally better for all three.

### Banking-Specific Ratios üè¶
* **interest_margin**: The difference between the interest income a bank earns on its assets (like loans) and the interest it pays on its liabilities (like deposits).
* **bad_debt_percentage**: The percentage of a bank's loans that are considered bad loans.
* **provision_on_bad_debt**: The ratio of loan loss provisions to the total amount of bad loans.
* **loan_on_deposit**: Measures the ratio of a bank's total loans to its total deposits.
* **credit_growth**: The rate at which a bank is increasing its lending.
