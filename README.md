# Financial Sector Analysis: Vietnam Banking vs. Securities

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive financial analysis comparing the investment viability of leading companies in Vietnam's banking and securities sectors. Using Python and financial data sourced via the `vnstock` library, I performed a deep-dive analysis of profitability, financial stability, and market valuation to generate an actionable investment thesis.

The primary tickers analyzed were:
* **Banks:** MBB, TCB
* **Securities Firms:** VCI, SSI, VND


## Skills Demonstrated
* **Data Analysis:** Processed and cleaned time-series financial data (Income Statements, Balance Sheets, Cash Flow).
* **Financial Modeling:** Calculated and interpreted key financial ratios (ROE, P/E, P/B, Debt/Equity).
* **Data Visualization:** Created multi-plot dashboards with `matplotlib` to perform comparative analysis and benchmark companies against historical and peer averages.
* **Investment Reporting:** Synthesized complex financial data into a professional-grade report with clear conclusions and recommendations.

## Key Findings & Investment Thesis
My research uncovered a stark divergence between the two sectors, forming a clear investment thesis: **Favor stability and value over cyclicality and speculation.**

1.  **Banks (MBB, TCB) - The Value Play:**
    * **Finding:** Exhibit stable, high-quality profitability with consistent growth.
    * **Thesis:** These banks are fundamentally strong yet appear **undervalued**, trading at low P/E and P/B ratios compared to their historical performance.

2.  **Securities Firms (VCI, SSI, VND) - The Risk Play:**
    * **Finding:** Show high earnings volatility, rising debt levels, and inconsistent cash flow.
    * **Thesis:** These firms appear significantly **overvalued**, with lofty market expectations that are disconnected from their current weaker performance and higher risk profile.


## Recommendation
Based on a superior risk/reward profile, the primary recommendation is to **overweight the banking sector**.

* **BUY:** **MBB & TCB** are identified as compelling, high-quality investments suitable for a core portfolio.
* **HOLD / REDUCE:** A cautious, underweight stance is recommended for **VCI, SSI, & VND** due to their unfavorable valuations and significant cyclical risks.
